# Serinus

Serinus is a minimalistic framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications powered by Dart. ðŸŽ¯

## Why Serinus?

Serinus aims to be a simple framework for building server-side applications. It is inspired by [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and it is designed to be easy to use and to integrate with your existing projects.

## Installation

### Using the CLI
  
::: tip
The CLI is still under development and more features will be added in the future.
:::

```console
dart pub global activate serinus_cli

serinus create my_project
```

This will create a new Serinus project in the `my_project` directory with the following structure:

```console
my_project
â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_project.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_controller.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_module.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_provider.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_routes.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_project.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
```

### From pub.dev

```console
dart pub add serinus
```
