# Why Serinus?

Serinus aims to be a simple and easy-to-use framework for building server-side applications. It is inspired by [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and it is designed to be easy to use and to integrate with your existing projects. It also has a shallow learning curve to ensure that developers can start building applications quickly.
