<script setup>
  import BtnLink from './components/btn-link.vue';
</script>

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
	<BtnLink link="/foundations/paths.html" title="Foundations" description="Important foundations of Serinus" />
	<BtnLink link="/core/modules.html" title="Core concepts" description="Core concepts of Serinus" />
	<BtnLink link="/validation/schema.html" title="Validation" description="Validate your requests" />

</div>

## Before you go

The Serinus team is always looking for ways to improve the framework and the documentation to make it easier for you to build your applications.

So, although the documentation is complete, it is not perfect. If you find any errors, typos, or have any suggestions for improvement, please let us know by creating an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/francescovallone/serinus).
