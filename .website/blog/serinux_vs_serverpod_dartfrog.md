One of the questions I get asked the most is how Serinus compares to other similar projects. Why should you choose Serinus over Serverpod or Dartfrog? In this article, I will try to answer this question by comparing the three projects in terms of features and ease to use.

::: tip
You should pick what fits your needs the best.

## Serverpod

Let's start with Serverpod.

Serverpod is "The missing server for Flutter" and while a lot of other projects are trying to do the same, Serverpod is actually the most complete and mature solution, with a lot of features and a big community. (I'm not affiliated with Serverpod in any way and to be honest, it hurts me to say this, but it's the truth).

Serverpod comes in two versions: the full version and the mini version.
